# Groth16 Gas Cost Analysis - Storage-Based Implementation

## Executive Summary

Based on the updated backend implementation using storage-based Merkle tree construction with Poseidon4, this document revises the gas cost analysis for the proposed Groth16 solution. The new backend uses `MAX_MT_LEAVES` storage entries with `Poseidon4(key, value, 0, 0)` leaf computation instead of participant-based RLC computation.

## Problem Statement: Hash Function Incompatibility

### Current Implementation Limitation

The current on-chain implementation uses **keccak256** for Merkle tree construction, but this creates a fundamental incompatibility:

```solidity
// Current on-chain implementation (RollupBridge.sol)
function _hashFour(bytes32 _a, bytes32 _b, bytes32 _c, bytes32 _d) internal pure returns (bytes32) {
    return keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_a, _b, _c, _d));  // ❌ Incompatible with backend
}
```

**However, the backend requires Poseidon4 over BLS12-381:**
```typescript
// Backend implementation requirement
leaves[i] = poseidon_raw([bytesToBigInt(key), bytesToBigInt(val), 0n, 0n])  // ✅ Required for backend
```

### Proposed Solution: Off-Chain Computation with ZK Proof Verification

Since Poseidon4 over BLS12-381 cannot be efficiently implemented on-chain, the solution is:

1. **Off-Chain Computation**: Compute the entire Poseidon4 Merkle tree off-chain using the backend
2. **Generate ZK Proof**: Create a Groth16 proof of correct tree computation
3. **On-Chain Verification**: Submit only the root + proof to the contract
4. **Verify Proof**: Use a Groth16 verifier contract to validate the computation

```solidity
// New proposed implementation
function initializeChannelStateWithProof(
    uint256 channelId,
    bytes32 merkleRoot,           // ✅ Poseidon4-computed root
    Groth16Proof calldata proof   // ✅ ZK proof of correctness
) external nonReentrant {
    // Verify the proof using Groth16 verifier
    require(verifier.verifyProof(proof, [merkleRoot, channelId]), "Invalid proof");
    
    // Store the verified root
    channel.initialStateRoot = merkleRoot;
    channel.state = ChannelState.Open;
    
    emit StateInitialized(channelId, merkleRoot);
}
```

### Why Direct On-Chain Poseidon4 is Impossible

1. **EVM Field Incompatibility**: 
   - EVM operates over the secp256k1 field (256-bit)
   - BLS12-381 scalar field is 255-bit with different modulus
   - No native EVM support for BLS12-381 field arithmetic

2. **Gas Cost Prohibitive**:
   - Actual implementation shows: **~1,000,000 gas per Poseidon4 hash**
   - For 16 leaves: 21 total hashes = **~21 million gas**
   - Exceeds typical block gas limit (~30M gas)
   - Would require multiple transactions to complete

3. **Complex Field Operations**:
   - Modular arithmetic over non-native field
   - S-box operations requiring expensive exponentiations
   - Matrix multiplications with large field elements

### Updated Backend Analysis

The backend now uses:
```typescript
// Storage-based leaf computation with Poseidon4
leaves[i] = poseidon_raw([bytesToBigInt(key), bytesToBigInt(val), 0n, 0n])

// Fixed tree structure optimized for Poseidon4
const treeDepth = Math.ceil(Math.log10(MAX_MT_LEAVES) / Math.log10(POSEIDON_INPUTS))

// IMT with Poseidon hash over BLS12-381
const mt = new TokamakL2MerkleTree(poseidon_raw, treeDepth, 0n, POSEIDON_INPUTS, leaves)
```

### Key Changes from Previous Analysis

1. **Hash Function Mismatch**: Backend uses Poseidon4/BLS12-381, on-chain uses keccak256
2. **EVM Incompatibility**: Poseidon4 over BLS12-381 cannot be efficiently implemented on-chain
3. **Fixed Tree Size**: Uses `MAX_MT_LEAVES = 16` regardless of participant count
4. **Storage-Based Leaves**: Each leaf is `Poseidon4(storage_key, storage_value, 0, 0)`
5. **IMT Structure**: Uses Incremental Merkle Tree with quaternary structure

## Revised Gas Cost Analysis

### Groth16 Solution: Off-Chain Computation + On-Chain Verification

With the correct understanding that Merkle tree computation happens off-chain, the gas analysis becomes much simpler:

**Groth16 On-Chain Operations:**
- **Proof verification**: ~80,000 gas (BN254 pairing operations)
- **Root storage**: ~22,000 gas (SSTORE)
- **Channel state updates**: ~10,000 gas
- **Address mappings**: 22,000 gas × participants (still needed for withdrawals)
- **Base setup**: ~20,000 gas

**Groth16 Gas Cost Formula:**
```
Total Gas = 132,000 + (22,000 × participants)
```

**Key Insight**: No storage entries need to be written on-chain! The Merkle tree computation is done off-chain and proven with ZK.

## Revised Groth16 Solution

### Updated Circuit Requirements

#### New Circuit Architecture
```circom
template TokamakStorageMerkleProof(max_storage_entries, tree_depth) {
    // Public inputs
    signal input merkle_root;
    signal input active_entries;
    signal input channel_id; // For verification context
    
    // Private inputs - storage data
    signal input storage_keys[max_storage_entries];
    signal input storage_values[max_storage_entries];
    
    // Compute storage-based leaves
    component storage_hasher[max_storage_entries];
    signal leaf_values[max_storage_entries];
    
    for (var i = 0; i < max_storage_entries; i++) {
        storage_hasher[i] = Poseidon(4);
        storage_hasher[i].inputs[0] <== storage_keys[i];
        storage_hasher[i].inputs[1] <== storage_values[i];
        storage_hasher[i].inputs[2] <== 0;
        storage_hasher[i].inputs[3] <== 0;
        leaf_values[i] <== storage_hasher[i].out;
    }
    
    // Build quaternary Merkle tree
    component merkle_tree = Poseidon4MerkleTree(tree_depth, max_storage_entries);
    merkle_tree.leaf_count <== active_entries;
    
    for (var i = 0; i < max_storage_entries; i++) {
        merkle_tree.leaves[i] <== leaf_values[i];
    }
    
    // Verify root
    merkle_root === merkle_tree.root;
}
```

#### Circuit Complexity (Updated)

For `MAX_MT_LEAVES = 16` entries:
- **Poseidon4 operations for leaves**: 16 × 1,200 = 19,200 constraints
- **Poseidon4 operations for tree**: 5 × 1,200 = 6,000 constraints  
- **Control logic**: ~1,000 constraints
- **Total**: ~26,200 constraints

This is a very manageable circuit size for modern ZK proving systems.

### Revised Gas consumption

#### Groth16 Verification Costs (Constant)
- **BN254 pairing verification**: ~80,000 gas
- **Public input processing**: ~5,000 gas
- **Contract overhead**: ~15,000 gas
- **Total verification**: ~100,000 gas (constant)

## Conclusion

The analysis reveals a **fundamental incompatibility** between the required backend implementation and EVM capabilities. The core issue is not just gas efficiency, but the **impossibility of implementing Poseidon4 over BLS12-381 on-chain** at any reasonable cost.

### Critical Findings

1. **Hash Function Incompatibility**: Backend requires Poseidon4/BLS12-381, but EVM only supports efficient operations over native fields
2. **Off-Chain Solution Required**: Direct on-chain Poseidon4 would cost ~21M gas for 16 leaves, exceeding practical limits
3. **ZK Proof Necessity**: Only way to verify off-chain Poseidon4 computation is through cryptographic proofs
4. **Significant Gas Savings**: Groth16 approach provides 35-65% gas savings over current implementation (dummy implementation using keccak)

### Why Groth16 is a Viable Solution

Given the backend's requirement for Poseidon4/BLS12-381, **Groth16 proof verification is the only practical way** to achieve compatibility:

- **Off-chain Computation**: Perform all Poseidon4 operations off-chain using optimal implementations
- **Cryptographic Guarantee**: Groth16 proof ensures computational integrity without revealing private data
- **EVM Compatibility**: Verification uses standard BN254 elliptic curve operations
- **Constant Verification Cost**: ~80,000 gas regardless of tree size or participant count
- **No Storage Overhead**: Eliminates need for expensive on-chain storage operations

### Revised Recommendations

**Groth16 implementation strategy:**

1. **Implement Groth16 Circuit**: Create circuit for Poseidon4 Merkle tree computation with 16 leaves
2. **Off-Chain Prover**: Build infrastructure to generate proofs during channel initialization
3. **On-Chain Verifier**: Deploy Groth16 verifier contract for proof validation
4. **Modified Bridge Contract**: Update `initializeChannelState` to accept root + proof instead of computing tree on-chain

### Updated Cost-Benefit Analysis

| Approach | Feasibility | Gas Cost | Compatibility | Storage Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Direct Poseidon4 on-chain** | ❌ Impossible | 21M gas | ✅ Full | ❌ Prohibitive |
| **Current keccak256** | ✅ Works | 303K-1.4M gas | ❌ Backend incompatible | ✅ Required |
| **Groth16 off-chain + verification** | ✅ Optimal | 198K-484K gas | ✅ Full | ❌ Not needed |

**Conclusion**: Groth16 is not just the only compatible solution—it's also the **most gas-efficient approach**. By moving computation off-chain and using ZK proofs for verification, we achieve both backend compatibility and significant gas savings (35-65% reduction).
