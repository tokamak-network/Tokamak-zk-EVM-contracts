# Script Output Directory

This directory contains generated JSON files with contract addresses and ABIs.

## File Types

### `contracts-<network>.json`
- Generated by deployment scripts (`deploy-v2.sh`), upgrade scripts (`upgrade-contracts.sh`) or the standalone generator (`generate-contracts-json.sh`)
- Contains all contract addresses and their corresponding ABIs
- For proxy contracts, shows proxy addresses with implementation ABIs

## JSON Structure

## Usage

These JSON files can be used by:
- Frontend applications to interact with contracts
- Testing frameworks to get contract addresses and ABIs
- Deployment verification scripts
- Integration with web3 libraries

## Notes

- Addresses are normalized to lowercase for consistency
