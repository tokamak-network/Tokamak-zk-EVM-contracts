# Script Output Directory

This directory contains generated JSON files with contract addresses and ABIs.

## File Types

### `contracts-<network>-<timestamp>.json`
- Generated by deployment scripts (`deploy-v2.sh`) or the standalone generator (`generate-contracts-json.sh`)
- Contains all contract addresses and their corresponding ABIs
- For proxy contracts, shows proxy addresses with implementation ABIs

### `upgrade-contracts-<network>-<timestamp>.json`
- Generated by upgrade scripts (`upgrade-contracts.sh`)
- Contains proxy addresses and new implementation addresses with ABIs
- Tracks upgrade history
